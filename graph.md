### [743. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/)

> There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

> Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

> Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.
